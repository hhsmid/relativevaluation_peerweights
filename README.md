Python code based on the the paper "Machine Learning-Based Relative Valuation: A Unified Framework with Peer Weights from Clustering and Tree-Based Models"

This repository includes all Python scripts needed to reproduce the analysis from the paper.

Abstract:
This thesis develops a unified machine learning framework for relative valuation, in which clustering and tree-based models are used to predict a firmâ€™s valuation multiple as a weighted average of its peers. Peer weights are derived from the models' underlying structures, enabling data-driven, but interpretable, peer selection and weighting across model classes. Empirical analysis shows that tree-based models, Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forests, achieve similar high valuation accuracy, despite generating different peer weight distributions. This suggests that distinct peer weighting schemes can be effective when aligned with model architecture. Clustering-based methods underperform in valuation accuracy compared to tree-based models, but offer computational advantages in constrained settings. To assess whether the valuation prediction errors reflect deviations from firms' fundamental value, I employ portfolio sorting and evaluate risk-adjusted returns in an asset pricing framework. I find that valuation errors from tree-based models capture fundamental value, generating statistically and economically significant returns unexplained by standard risk factors. The proposed framework advances explainable machine learning in finance, offering researchers a rigorous model comparison tool and practitioners a scalable, accurate alternative to traditional valuation methods.
