Abstract:

This thesis develops a unified machine learning framework for relative valuation, in which clustering and tree-based models are used to predict a firmâ€™s valuation multiple---standardized metric of firm value---as a weighted average of its peers. Peer weights are derived from the models' underlying structures, enabling data-driven, but interpretable, peer selection and weighting across model classes. Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forests deliver similarly high valuation accuracy---outperforming clustering methods---despite producing distinct peer weight patterns, highlighting the effectiveness of diverse peer weighting schemes across model classes. Clustering-based methods underperform in valuation accuracy compared to tree-based models, but offer computational advantages in constrained settings. To assess whether the valuation prediction errors reflect deviations from firms' fundamental value, I employ portfolio sorting and evaluate risk-adjusted returns in an asset pricing framework. I find that valuation errors from tree-based models capture deviations from fundamental value, generating statistically and economically significant returns unexplained by standard risk factors. The proposed framework advances explainable machine learning in finance, offering researchers a rigorous model comparison tool and practitioners a scalable, accurate alternative to traditional valuation methods.
