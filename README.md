Python code based on the the paper "Machine Learning-Based Relative Valuation: A Unified Framework with Peer Weights from Clustering and Tree-Based Models"

This repository includes all Python scripts needed to reproduce the analysis from the paper.

Abstract:
This thesis introduces a novel framework integrating machine learning into relative valuation by using clustering and tree-based models to predict companies' valuation multiples as peer-weighted averages of comparable companies. The key contribution is the development of these "peer weights," derived from cluster assignments and tree structures, which consistently inform peer selection and weighting across model classes. Empirical analysis shows that tree-based models generate highly concentrated peer weights with superior valuation accuracy, while soft clustering methods yield diffuse weights and weaker predictive power. Tree-based models generally outperform clustering methods in valuation accuracy over time and across industries. To assess whether the valuation prediction errors reflect deviations from fundamental value, I leverage portfolio sorting and assess risk-adjusted returns using Fama-French factor models. I find that valuation errors derived from tree-based models predict future returns, generating significant risk-adjusted alphas in Fama-French asset pricing frameworks. The proposed approach offers an actionable framework for equity research, corporate finance, asset pricing, and portfolio management.
